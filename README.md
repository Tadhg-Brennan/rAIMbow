This is a LGBT+ themed aim training game.
The goal of the game is to rack up as many points as possible by hitting the correct targets with your fingerguns.
+100 points for hitting a correct target, -50 for hitting an incorrect target.
The correct box to hit will be displayed prominently at the top of the HUD.

This game was made as a personal project and not for profit.
