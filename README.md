This is a LGBT+ themed aim training game.
The goal of the game is to rack up as many points as possible by hitting the correct flags with your laser gun
(the laser solely highlights the flags, it does not harm them).
+100 points for hitting a correct target, -50 for hitting an incorrect target.
The correct flag to hit will be displayed prominently at the top of the HUD.

This game was made as a personal project and not for profit.
